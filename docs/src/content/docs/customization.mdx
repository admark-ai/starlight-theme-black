## Custom CSS

To customize the styles applied to your Starlight site when using the Starlight Black theme, you can providing additional CSS files to modify or extend the Starlight and the Starlight Black theme default styles.

[Learn more about custom CSS in the Starlight documentation.](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles)

## Cascade layers

Like Starlight, the Starlight Black theme uses [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers) internally to manage the order of its styles.
This ensures a predictable CSS order and allows for simpler overrides.
Any custom unlayered CSS will override the default styles from the `starlight` and `black` layers.

If you are using cascade layers, you can use [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) in your [custom CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) to define the order of precedence for different layers relative to the Starlight and Starlight Black theme styles:

```css "starlight" "black"
/* src/styles/custom.css */
@layer my-reset, starlight, black, my-overrides;
```

The example above defines a custom layer named `my-reset`, applied before all the Starlight and Starlight Black theme layers, and another named `my-overrides`, applied after all Starlight and Starlight Black theme layers.
Any styles in the `my-overrides` layer would take precedence over the Starlight and Starlight Black theme styles, but Starlight or the Starlight Black theme could still change styles set in the `my-reset` layer.

## Tailwind CSS

Following the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#create-a-new-project-with-tailwind).
